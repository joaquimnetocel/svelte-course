# REACTIVE VARIABLES

## UNDERSTANDING THE PROBLEM

IN ADDITION TO KEEPING THE TEMPLATE IN SYNCHRONY WITH THE VARIABLES (AS WE SAW IN THE PREVIOUS SECTION), THE REACTIVITY OF SVELTE IS CAPABLE OF KEEPING VARIABLES IN SYNCHRONY WITH OTHER VARIABLES. BUT FIRST, LET'S UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM AND REALIZE THAT THIS IS NOT SOMETHING CARRIED OUT AUTOMATICALLY. THE FOLLOWING EXAMPLE ILLUSTRATES THE PROBLEM:

```svelte
<script>
let numberAge = 20;
let numberDoubleAge = 2*numberAge;
function functionIncreaseAge() {
    numberAge = numberAge + 1;
}
</script>

<p>THE AGE IS {numberAge} AND ITS DOUBLE IS {numberDoubleAge}.</p>
<button on:click={functionIncreaseAge}>INCREASE</button>
```

[RUN CODE](https://svelte.dev/repl/683c5ee5076d474781b5a462d9695119)

AS WE CAN SEE IN THE EXAMPLE ABOVE, WHEN CLICKING ON THE BUTTON, ONLY THE `numberAge` VARIABLE IS CHANGED AND THE `numberDoubleAge` IS NOT RECALCULATED.

## THE SOLUTION

TO MAKE A VARIABLE REACTIVE WE CAN DO THE FOLLOWING:

```svelte
<script>
let numberAge = 20;
$: numberDoubleAge = 2*numberAge;

function functionIncreaseAge() {
    numberAge += 1;
}
</script>

<p>THE AGE IS {numberAge} AND ITS DOUBLE IS {numberDoubleAge}.</p>
<button on:click={functionIncreaseAge}>INCREASE</button>
```

[RUN CODE](https://svelte.dev/repl/10dd3b43ea154659af9c28f4776d0f3f)

HERE, THE `$` TELLS SVELTE TO RE-RUN THIS CODE WHENEVER ANY OF THE REFERENCED VALUES CHANGE.

OF COURSE, YOU COULD JUST WRITE `{numberAge * 2}` DIRECTLY AND AVOID USING REACTIVE VARIABLES. REACTIVE VARIABLES BECOME PARTICULARLY VALUABLE WHEN YOU NEED TO REFERENCE THEM MULTIPLE TIMES, OR YOU HAVE VALUES THAT DEPEND ON OTHER REACTIVE VALUES.
