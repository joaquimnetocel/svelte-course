# COMPONENTS

MODERN WEB DEVELOPMENT IS VERY MUCH FOCUSED ON COMPONENTS, AND SVELTE IS NO DIFFERENT.

WHAT IS A COMPONENT? A COMPONENT IS A PART OF THE APPLICATION. MORE SPECIFICALLY, A COMPONENT IS A REUSABLE SELF-CONTAINED BLOCK OF CODE THAT ENCAPSULATES HTML, CSS AND JAVASCRIPT AND IS USED TO  REPRESENT A PART OF THE USER INTERFACE. EACH SVELTE COMPONENT IS DECLARED IN A `.svelte` FILE.

LET'S SEE THE EXAMPLE OF A COMPONENT IN SVELTE:

```svelte
<script>
console.log("WELCOME!");
</script>

<h1>TITLE</h1>
<p>MY FIRST <span class="classColor">COMPONENT</span>.</p>

<style>
    .classColor {
        color: red;
    }
</style>
```

[RUN CODE](https://svelte.dev/repl/8317951f7e3f45b7b5d908ed6134d710)

AS WE CAN SEE, SVELTE FILES CAN BE DIVIDED INTO THREE PARTS:

* **THE BEHAVIOR:** JAVASCRIPT CODE (WRAPPED BY THE `script` TAG).
* **CONTENT:** HTML/CSS CODE (THIS PART OF THE FILE IS COMMONLY CALLED _TEMPLATE_).
* **FORMATTING STYLES:** CSS CODE (WRAPPED BY THE `style` TAG).

## USING JAVASCRIPT IN THE TEMPLATE

SVELTE ALLOWS THE USE OF VARIABLES AND JAVASCRIPT CODE DIRECTLY IN THE TEMPLATE. TO DO THIS, JUST PUT ANY JAVASCRIPT YOU WANT INSIDE THE CURLY BRACES. USE A PAIR OF CURLY BRACES: `{}`. LET'S SEE THE EXAMPLE:

```svelte
<script>
const stringWord = "HOUSE";
</script>

<p>THE NUMBER OF LETTERS IN THE WORD <span class="classColor">{stringWord}</span> IS {stringWord.length}.</p>

<style>
    .classColor {
        color: red;
    }
</style>
```

[RUN CODE](https://svelte.dev/repl/1af723b3f1de4f0393661e69cec8d27a)

IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE TO USE CURLY BRACES TO CONTROL ELEMENTS ATTRIBUTES. LET'S SEE THE EXAMPLE:

```svelte
<script>
    const stringText = "JOHN";
</script>

<p>WHAT IS YOUR NAME? <input value={stringText}></p>
```

[RUN CODE](https://svelte.dev/repl/988f0263e65e42a98d464fddaa580902)

## SHORTHAND ATTRIBUTES

IF THE ATTRIBUTE NAME AND VARIABLE NAME ARE THE SAME, SVELTE ALLOWS A CONVENIENT SHORTHAND:

```svelte
<script>
const value = "BANANA";
</script>

WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE FRUIT? <input {value}/>
<!-- HERE WE USED {value} AS A SHORTHAND OF value={value} -->
```

[RUN THE CODE](https://svelte.dev/repl/afb46cbc73c94035b23971a37a909bbb)

## COMPONENTS HAVE LOCAL SCOPE

EXCEPT IF DELIBERATELY SPECIFIED, THE CSS AND THE JAVASCRIPT DEFINED ARE INTERNAL TO THE COMPONENT AND DO NOT "LEAK" OUTSIDE. IN OTHER WORDS, GENERALLY, THE CSS AND JAVASCRIPT DEFINED IN A COMPONENT DOES NOT AFFECT OTHER COMPONENTS. LATER WE WILL SEE THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO DELIBERATELY PROMOTE THE EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION BETWEEN COMPONENTS.
